Part 1: 
Using the API docs provided, design the tables with the columns you will need to create in order to serve queries about the questions above. List out all of the table names and columns in a text file to be submitted with the homework. Additionally, create a SQLite database and create the schema/tables that you designed in that database.

================== Solution: ================
The three queries we need to answer are: 
- 1. What is the average weight of the pokemon by Pokemon type?
- 2. List the highest accuracy move by Pokemon type
- 3. Count the number of moves by Pokemon and order from greatest to least 


I will use three different tables to answer three questions. 

# -------- Question 1: ------------

# since sqlite internally only use TEXT, we won't save any space by using CHAR or VARCHAR type
CREATE TABLE "pokemon_weight_table" (
    "name"      TEXT   NOT NULL,
    "type"      TEXT   NOT NULL,
    "weight"    REAL,
    PRIMARY KEY (name, type)
);

Result:
     type  avg(weight)
0     bug   145.833333
1    fire   393.333333
2  flying   612.500000
3   grass   399.666667
4  poison   271.000000
5   water   390.000000



# ------- Question 2: --------
CREATE TABLE "pokemon_move_accuracy_table" (
    "name"    TEXT  NOT NULL,
    "type"    TEXT  NOT NULL,  
    "move"    TEXT  NOT NULL,  
    "accuracy" REAL,
    PRIMARY KEY (name, type, move)
);

Result:
     type  max(accuracy)         move
0     bug          100.0  double-edge
1    fire          100.0   fire-punch
2  flying          100.0   razor-wind
3   grass          100.0   razor-wind
4  poison          100.0  double-edge
5   water          100.0    ice-punch



# --------- Question 3: ----------

CREATE TABLE "pokemon_move_list_table" (
    "name"   TEXT  NOT NULL  PRIMARY KEY,
    "move"   TEXT  NOT NULL
);


Result: 
          name  move_number
0    charizard          108
1   charmander           93
2    blastoise           93
3     squirtle           91
4   charmeleon           84
5    bulbasaur           78
6     venusaur           77
7   butterfree           77
8    wartortle           76
9     beedrill           75
10     ivysaur           66
11     metapod            5
12      kakuna            5
13    caterpie            5
14      weedle            4

Thank you for creating this fun assignment about Pokemon! Please let me know if you have any questions.
I am looking forward to discuss further.
